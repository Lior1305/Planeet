## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Google Places API**:
   - Get a Google Places API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable the Places API service
   - Set your API key in `app/services/place_finder.py`:
   ```python
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. **Configure MongoDB (for Ontopo caching)**:
   - The service uses MongoDB to cache Ontopo reservation links
   - Update the connection string in `app/services/ontopo_scraper.py` if needed
   - Default: Uses MongoDB Atlas cloud database

5. **Install ChromeDriver (for Ontopo scraping)**:
   - Download ChromeDriver from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
   - Place `chromedriver.exe` in the service root directory
   - Ensure Chrome browser is installed on the system

6. Run the service:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

## üß† **Personalization Algorithm**

The service uses a sophisticated weighted scoring system to personalize venue recommendations:

### **Scoring Weights**
- **Venue Type**: 25% - Matches preferred venue types (restaurant, cafe, museum, etc.)
- **Price Range**: 20% - Compatibility with budget preferences ($, $$, $$$)
- **Amenities**: 15% - Percentage of preferred amenities available
- **Rating**: 15% - How well venue rating meets minimum requirements
- **Location**: 15% - City preference matching
- **Dietary**: 10% - Accommodation of dietary restrictions

### **Scoring Logic**
- **Perfect Match**: 1.0 (exact preference match)
- **Close Match**: 0.7 (within acceptable range)
- **Partial Match**: 0.3-0.6 (some compatibility)
- **No Match**: 0.0 (incompatible)

### **Personalization Features**
- **User Preference Integration**: Fetches preferences from Outing-Profile-Service
- **Smart Ranking**: Venues automatically sorted by personalization score
- **Flexible Matching**: Handles missing preferences gracefully
- **Real-time Scoring**: Calculated on-demand for each search

## üåê **Google Places API Integration**

The service integrates with Google Places API to provide real-time venue discovery during plan generation:

### **How It Works**
1. **Plan Request**: User requests venues for specific types (restaurant, museum, etc.)
2. **Location Search**: Uses coordinates and radius to search Google Places API
3. **Venue Discovery**: Finds real venues with ratings, prices, and amenities
4. **Data Conversion**: Converts Google Places data to internal Venue objects
5. **Personalization**: Applies user preferences to rank discovered venues
6. **Plan Generation**: Creates comprehensive outing plan with real venue data

### **Venue Type Mapping**
- **restaurant** ‚Üí Google Places "restaurant"
- **cafe** ‚Üí Google Places "cafe"
- **bar** ‚Üí Google Places "bar"
- **museum** ‚Üí Google Places "museum"
- **theater** ‚Üí Google Places "movie_theater"
- **park** ‚Üí Google Places "park"
- **shopping_center** ‚Üí Google Places "shopping_mall"
- **sports_facility** ‚Üí Google Places "gym"
- **hotel** ‚Üí Google Places "lodging"

### **Data Extraction**
- **Location**: Coordinates, address, city extraction
- **Rating**: User ratings from Google
- **Price Level**: Converted to $, $$, $$$ format
- **Amenities**: Extracted from place types (wheelchair accessible, parking, wifi, etc.)
- **Links**: Official websites when available

### **Benefits**
- **Real-time Data**: Always up-to-date venue information
- **Rich Details**: Ratings, prices, amenities from Google
- **Global Coverage**: Works worldwide with Google's extensive database
- **Automatic Updates**: No need to manually maintain venue database

## üçΩÔ∏è **Ontopo Integration for Food Venues**

The service automatically adds reservation links for restaurants and cafes using the Ontopo platform:

### **How It Works**
1. **Venue Discovery**: When a restaurant or cafe is found via Google Places API
2. **Automatic Scraping**: Ontopo scraper searches for the venue on Ontopo.com
3. **Reservation Link**: Extracts the direct reservation link for the venue
4. **Caching**: Stores discovered links in MongoDB for future use
5. **Link Attachment**: Automatically adds reservation links to venue objects

### **Supported Venue Types**
- **Restaurants**: Automatic reservation link discovery
- **Cafes**: Automatic reservation link discovery
- **Other Venues**: No automatic reservation links (only official websites if available)

### **Link Types Added**
- **Official Website**: From Google Places API (when available)
- **Reservation Link**: From Ontopo scraper (restaurants & cafes only)
- **Booking Type**: Marked as "booking" for easy identification

### **Benefits**
- **Seamless Booking**: Users can book tables directly from venue suggestions
- **Israeli Market Focus**: Optimized for Israeli restaurant booking via Ontopo
- **Smart Caching**: Avoids re-scraping for previously discovered venues
- **Automatic Discovery**: No manual work needed to add booking links

## Data Persistence

The service currently uses JSON-based file storage for data persistence. Data is automatically saved to the `data/` directory:
- `data/venues.json` - Venue data including links

## Future Enhancements

- Database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Authentication and authorization
- Image upload and storage
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external APIs (Google Places, Yelp, etc.)
- Link validation and health checking
- Automated link discovery and scraping
- **Machine learning** for preference learning
- **Collaborative filtering** for group recommendations
- **Real-time preference updates** from Planning Service

## Development

The service is built with:
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **Python 3.8+**: Modern Python features
- **httpx**: Async HTTP client for service integration
- **requests**: HTTP client for Google Places API integration
- **pymongo**: MongoDB client for caching Ontopo links
- **selenium**: Web scraping for Ontopo reservation links
- **ChromeDriver**: Browser automation for web scraping
