## *1️⃣ What is the problem you are trying to solve?*

Planning group outings involves two major challenges:  

1. **Mental Effort:** Brainstorming and organizing ideas that suit everyone’s preferences can be time-consuming and overwhelming.  
2. **Coordination Complexity:** Synchronizing these ideas with real-time availability of venues, while balancing diverse schedules, adds another layer of difficulty.  
&nbsp;  
These obstacles often lead to:  
- **Delays** in decision-making.  
- **Indecision** that stalls plans.  
- **Abandoned outings** altogether.  



### The Project Aims To:  
1. **Enable users** to input preferences and availability, streamlining group decision-making.  
2. **Provide tailored recommendations** by integrating real-time data from venues.  
3. **Deliver an intuitive interface** to enhance user experience and simplify collaboration.  



### Success Metrics
The project’s success will be measured by:  
- **Accuracy of Recommendations:** Ensuring the app generates realistic and useful options.  
- **User Satisfaction:** Conducting a survey after activities to gauge ease of use and outcomes.  
- **Successful Outings:** Tracking the number of group activities planned through the app.  



### Potential Impact  
This project has the potential to create significant positive outcomes:  

- **Enhanced Social Interactions:** By simplifying the planning process, more successful group outings can occur.  
- **Boosted Productivity:** Helping teams plan activities efficiently to foster team-building.  
- **Economic Benefits:** Supporting local businesses by connecting them with customers who are ready to book.

## *2️⃣ Describe briefly, in high level your presumed solution*

Our solution is a web-based application that simplifies planning group outings. Users input their group preferences, schedules, and location, and the app does the heavy lifting by integrating real-time data from venues (e.g., availability, capacity, type of activity).  
This enables it to generate tailored recommendations and streamline decision-making, ensuring plans are made quickly and collaboratively.

### Key Advantages:
The project alleviates the stress of organizing group activities, allowing users to focus on enjoying their time together.   

Positive Outcomes:
- **Time-Saving:** Automates brainstorming and coordination.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Streamlines decision-making tools to minimize miscommunication.
- **Enhanced Experiences:** Ensures plans are successfully executed, fostering more frequent and satisfying gatherings.

## *3️⃣ Are there other approaches?*

### *1. Searching Manually Online*
**What Users Do:**
- Search for activities on Google, TripAdvisor, or similar platforms.
- Manually compare options for restaurants, movies, or other events.
- Check availability by visiting individual websites or calling venues.
- Build their own schedule by coordinating activities and timing themselves.
**Challenges:**
- Time-consuming and overwhelming.
- Requires users to navigate multiple platforms.
- Difficult to consolidate information into a cohesive plan.

### *2. Using Social Media Recommendations*
**What Users Do:**
- Browse Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok for trending spots or events.
- Check posts, hashtags, and influencer recommendations for inspiration.
- Use social media reviews to gauge the quality of venues or activities.
- Coordinate with friends via messaging platforms to plan.
**Challenges:**
- Suggestions may not match the user's schedule or location.
- Lack of real-time availability information.
- Reliance on user-curated content, which may not always be up-to-date.

### *3. Asking Friends or Family*
**What Users Do:**
- Reach out to their social circle for recommendations on where to go or what to do.
- Get suggestions based on personal experiences or preferences.
- Sometimes form group plans directly based on these recommendations.
**Challenges:**
- Suggestions may not be personalized to the user's specific needs or timing.
- Limited to the experiences and knowledge of the user's network.


### *4. Relying on Local Events Apps*
**What Users Do:**
- Use apps like Meetup, Eventbrite, or local city guides to find events happening near them.
- Browse for one-off events like concerts, workshops, or pop-ups.
- Register for or purchase tickets directly through the app.
**Challenges:**
- These apps often focus on events, not casual outings like dinner or movies.
- Limited flexibility for users who want mixed-activity plans.


### *5. Walking Around or Exploring Spontaneously*
**What Users Do:**
- Head to a popular area (like a shopping district or entertainment hub) and explore options in person.
- Choose restaurants, cafes, or activities on the spot based on visible cues like menus, crowds, or atmosphere.
**Challenges:**
- Highly inefficient and unpredictable.
- May not work for people with limited time or specific preferences.
- Can lead to disappointment if venues are full or unavailable.


### *6. Traditional Travel Agents or Concierge Services*
**What Users Do:**
- Contact a travel agent or concierge service to help plan outings.
- Receive pre-planned schedules or activity suggestions tailored to their requests.
**Challenges:**
- Usually expensive and focused on travelers rather than locals.
- Less flexible and often outdated compared to real-time digital solutions.

### *7. Using Multiple Specialized Apps*
**What Users Do:**
- Use individual apps for different activities (e.g., OpenTable for restaurants, Fandango for movies, ClassPass for activities).
- Manually combine plans from each app to create a cohesive schedule.
**Challenges:**
- Requires juggling multiple apps, each with a unique interface.
- No centralized way to manage or optimize a full schedule.

### *8. Following Pre-Defined Plans from Bloggers or Influencers*
**What Users Do:**
- Follow blog posts or YouTube videos with pre-defined itineraries for specific occasions (e.g., “One Day in Tel Aviv” or “Best Date Night Spots”).
- Replicate the suggested plans and modify them slightly if needed.
**Challenges:**
- Plans may not align perfectly with the user's timing, budget, or group size.
- No flexibility for real-time adjustments.
